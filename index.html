    <p>I am an evolutionary geneticist interested in the evolution of behavioral isolation and the origin of species.
</p>
    <p>I study crickets to address diverse questions about animal behavior, the genetics of complex, quantitative traits, and speciation genomics.
&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Cricket males are the oldest musicians on earth and different species often have very different songs, which they produce with their wings to attract a female. The females, on their turn, choose their mates carefully and this choice is strongly dependent on the mating song produced by the males. This leads to strong sexual selection on the male song. When songs evolve, males will no longer be attractive to females in the population they once were. This process is called behavioral isolation and is considered to be the strongest, most common, and most rapidly evolving barrier betwee geographically proximate populations. 
</p>
    <p>My research focusses on the co-evolution of male song and female preference behavior and the underlying quantitative genetics. I also work with large genomic data sets to infer how population genetic patterns change over time in various biogeographic contexts and in response to sexual selection. 	</p>
