    <p><b>Quantitative genetics and speciation genomics of behavioral isolation</b><br></p>
    <p><span>Understanding the speciation process and, more generally, the processes that create and maintain biodiversity, lies at the heart of evolutionary biology. It also has diverse applications, ranging from physical and mental health treatments to predicting population responses of harmful and beneficial organisms to our rapidly changing climate. 
&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>Speciation is dependent on natural and sexual selection and drift that change allele frequencies over time (genetic divergence). New species arise when once interbreeding populations become separated by geographic or phenotypic barriers that limit gene flow, the exchange of genetic material between individuals. However, the evolution of phenotypes that contribute to these barriers and the likelihood of speciation depends on many interacting properties of the biology of the organism, the biotic and abiotic environment in which the organisms resides, and the genomic architecture of phenotypes under selection. The genomic architecture refers here to the number and distribution of genes and structural properties of chromosomes that affect genetic recombination, a process that reshuffles alleles after mating in virtually all animals and plants. I use quantitative genetics, the study of the genetic basis of traits controlled by many genes of small effect, and speciation genomics, the study of genome-wide effects from gene flow, selection, and recombination, to understand the genomic architecture of speciation in crickets.</span>

    <div class="fig1legend text">Left: Hawaiian swordtail cricket male singing to attract a female. Right: a female walking towards a singing male (phonotaxis). The co-evolution of male song and female preference has given rise to many different cricket species around the world. What are the conditions under which song and preference co-evolve and diverge enough between closely related populations so that the populations become genetically separated?</div>
